METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------

1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data:

Leaf-level spectra were taken on intact fasicles opposite to fasicles tapped for gas exchange measurements. One to three fasicles were arranged on a black nonreflective background and held in place with rubber bands. Two averaged spectral readings were taken per fasicle, avoiding gaps between needles with the handheld contact probe.

Fresh leaf-tissue samples for NSC quantification were collected in the field, stored on dry ice, microwaved for 3 minutes to stop enzymatic activity, and dried.

Gas exchange parameters including net photosynthesis rate (A) and stomatal conductance (gs) were measured using the LI-6800 Portable Photosynthesis System (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA). Measurements were conducted on mature, healthy leaf fasicles under controlled environmental conditions within the leaf chamber. Data were recorded once steady-state values were achieved after 2–3 minutes of stabilization.

Leaf water potential was determined using a pressure chamber (Water Potential Pressure Chamber – Standard, Edaphic Scientific, Moorabbin, VIC, Australia). Immediately after gas exchange measurements, similar paired fasicles were removed removed and placed in a dark cooler until the chamber could be reached (seasonal) OR immediately placed in the chamber to measure diurnal water potential (diurnals).

2. Methods for processing the data:

Gas exchange raw data were checked, unstable or flagged data points removed. For each fasicle, steady-state values were averaged over the measurement period. Environmental conditions inside the chamber (temperature, light, CO₂, humidity) were monitored and kept consistent across samples.

Water potential pressure readings indicating xylem sap emergence at the petiole cut were recorded as leaf water potential.

DATA & FILE OVERVIEW
---------------------
This data set contains diurnal gas exchange data from PIAL & PIFL individuals sampled along the Mt. Glory trail in Wilson, WY. 

the content of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, β-carotene, lutein, neoxanthin, violaxanthin, antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin pigments from tree and grassland species sampled at the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve in East Bethel, MN.

Mass- and area-based pigment contents were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Data were collected as part of the Dimensions of Biodiversity project “Linking remotely sensed optical diversity to genetic, phylogenetic and functional diversity to predict ecosystem processes”.

We used this data together with leaf-level spectral measurements to build partial least squares regression (PLSR) models for predicting leaf traits from spectra.
